- **Multiple Sessions & Semesters**: Allows users to enter data across multiple sessions and semesters.
- **Customizable Course Units and Grades**: Supports custom units for each course and allows selection of grades from a dropdown menu.
- **Real-time Calculation**: GPA and CGPA are calculated instantly as you enter the data.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For creating an interactive user interface.
- **Python**: The core programming language for logic and calculations.

## Application Features

- **4.0 GPA/CGPA Calculator**: 
  - Supports grades `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `F` for GPA calculation.
  - Calculates GPA for each session and semester, and displays the final CGPA.

- **5.0 GPA/CGPA Calculator**: 
  - Supports grades `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `F` for GPA calculation.
  - Calculates GPA for each session and semester, and displays the final CGPA.


## 4.0 GPA & CGPA Calculator

This section calculates GPA and CGPA based on the **4.0 grading scale**. The grades are mapped as follows:

- **A** â†’ 4.0
- **B** â†’ 3.0
- **C** â†’ 2.0
- **D** â†’ 1.0
- **F** â†’ 0.0

### Features

- Calculates **GPA** for each session and semester.
- Computes **CGPA** for all sessions after the final semester.
- Allows input of grades, course units, and number of semesters for each session.

### Example Workflow

1. Select the number of sessions and semesters.
2. Enter the number of courses per semester.
3. Input the course name, grade (A-F), and course unit for each course.
4. The GPA for each semester and session will be calculated automatically.
5. The CGPA for all sessions is displayed at the end.

## 5.0 GPA & CGPA Calculator

This section calculates GPA and CGPA based on the **5.0 grading scale**. The grades are mapped as follows:

- **A** â†’ 5.0
- **B** â†’ 4.0
- **C** â†’ 3.0
- **D** â†’ 2.0
- **E** â†’ 1.0
- **F** â†’ 0.0

### Features

- Calculates **GPA** for each session and semester.
- Computes **CGPA** for all sessions after the final semester.
- Allows input of grades, course units, and number of semesters for each session.

### Example Workflow

1. Select the number of sessions and semesters.
2. Enter the number of courses per semester.
3. Input the course name, grade (A-F), and course unit for each course.
4. The GPA for each semester and session will be calculated automatically.
5. The CGPA for all sessions is displayed at the end.
